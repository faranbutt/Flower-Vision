# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Vision â€“ Flower Classification with PyTorch & Optuna

**Live Demo:** [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/faranbutt789/flower-vision)

Flower Vision is a deep learning project for classifying flower images. The model uses **ResNet18**, optimized via **Optuna** hyperparameter tuning, and is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for interactive use.

## Project Overview
Flower Vision classifies images of 5 types of flowers using PyTorch. It includes:
- Data cleaning from CSV files
- Custom PyTorch Dataset & DataLoader
- ResNet18 pretrained backbone with custom classifier
- Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces

---


## Dataset
- 5 flower classes: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, Tulip
- Images stored in `/flowers_5_jpeg/flower_photos/`
- Separate CSV files for train and evaluation sets
- Cleaned CSVs ensure only valid paths are used

---

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- CSVs are cleaned using a custom function to verify local image paths
- Images resized to **224x224**
- Normalized using standard ImageNet mean and std
- Custom PyTorch `FlowersDatasetV1` handles image loading and label encoding

---

## Model Architecture
- Backbone: **ResNet18** pretrained on ImageNet
- Classifier head:
  - Dropout (tunable)
  - Fully connected layer to 5 classes
- Optimized using CrossEntropyLoss
- Hyperparameters optimized via **Optuna**:
  - Learning rate
  - Batch size
  - Dropout
  - Optimizer choice (Adam/SGD)

---

## Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Training uses **early stopping** to prevent overfitting
- Data split: 80% train, 20% validation
- Optuna searches for the best combination of hyperparameters
- Best model checkpoint is saved as `flower_checkpoint.pth`

---

## Evaluation
- Evaluated on cleaned test set
- Metrics reported:
  - Evaluation Loss
  - Accuracy
- Example evaluation output:
```text
Evaluation Loss: 0.3456
Evaluation Accuracy: 0.9123
```

---

## Visualization
- Predicted vs True labels are visualized
- Correct predictions: **green**, Incorrect predictions: **red**

Example:

## Deployment
- Model checkpoint and metadata uploaded to Hugging Face Hub
- Interactive demo available: [Flower Vision Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/faranbutt789/flower-vision)
- Users can upload images and get real-time predictions
